# PerformanceAnalysisOfCommunicationSystems


In this project, several simplified binary communication schemes are studied. In
particular, all these schemes are simulated and the results are compared with theoretical
values. For this study, an additive white Gaussian noise(AWGN) channel with binary
antipodal signaling(binary phase shift keying), on-off signaling, and quadrature phase
shift keying(QPSK) schemes are considered.
